# 1. Digital Clock with Tkinter

This project is a simple digital clock application built using Python's Tkinter library. It displays the current time in a user-friendly graphical interface, updating every second.

## Features
- **Real-Time Clock:** Shows the current time in hours, minutes, and seconds, along with the date.
- **Customizable GUI:** Easy to modify the appearance by changing font and colors.

## How It Works
- The `tkinter` library is used to create the graphical user interface.
- The `time` function retrieves the current time using the `strftime` method and updates the display every second.
